# How to contribute your changes to the plugins

1. Create a github issue for your feature/problem you want to solve
2. Implement solution on a branch in your fork
3. Once you're done create Pull Request and ask at least one of the maintainers for review (@ndeloof, @ewelinawilkosz)

!! Never push directly to this repository
